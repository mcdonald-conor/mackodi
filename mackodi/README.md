# Mackodi

**The "boring" Kodi build for Amazon Firestick Lite.**

Mackodi is a minimal, performance-first configuration designed to be stable, fast, and predictable. It is not flashy. It does not have animated widgets. It just plays movies and TV shows.

## Supported Devices
- **Primary:** Amazon Firestick Lite
- **Future:** Firestick 4K / 4K Max

## Installation

1. **Enable Unknown Sources** on your Firestick (Settings > My Fire TV > Developer Options).
2. **Install Kodi** (v20 Nexus or v21 Omega) using the Downloader app.
3. **Open Kodi** and go to **Settings > File Manager > Add Source**.
4. Enter `https://mcdonaldconor.github.io/mackodi/repo` and name it `.mackodi`.
5. Go to **Add-ons > Install from zip file > .mackodi > plugin.program.mackodi.installer.zip** and run the installer.

## What is Included
- **Movies & TV:** Powered by Fen Light (requires Real Debrid).
- **YouTube:** The official addon, easily accessible.
- **Sports:** A single, reliable addon for UK Football.
- **Performance:** Tuned `advancedsettings.xml` for low-RAM devices.

## What is Excluded
- **Bloat:** No maintenance scripts, cleaners, or skin helpers.
- **Widgets:** No heavy, slow-loading home screen widgets.
- **Custom Skins:** Uses the default Estuary skin for maximum speed.

## Update Philosophy
Mackodi is designed to be **stable**. We do not push updates for the sake of it. Updates will only be released to fix broken functionality or critical bugs.
